# Google Maps API Key Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and add your actual API key

# Get your API key from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key-here

# Note: 
# - In local development, the API key is read from this .env file
# - In production (Cloud Foundry), the API key is managed via BTP Destination service
#   and should NOT be set as an environment variable
# - Never commit the .env file to Git (it's in .gitignore)
